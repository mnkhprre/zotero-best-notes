## Development & Contributing

This addon is built based on the [Zotero Addon Template](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-addon-template).

### Build

```shell
# A release-it command: version increase, npm run build, git push, and GitHub release
# You need to set the environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN https://github.com/settings/tokens
# release-it: https://github.com/release-it/release-it
npm run release
```

Alternatively, build it directly using build.js: `npm run build`

### Debug

1. Copy the Zotero command line config file. Modify the commands.

```sh
cp zotero-cmd-default.json zotero-cmd.json
```

2. Initialize the addon development environment following this [link](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/plugin_development#setting_up_a_plugin_development_environment).

3. Build the addon and restart Zotero with this npm command.

```sh
npm run restart
```

You can also debug code in these ways:
